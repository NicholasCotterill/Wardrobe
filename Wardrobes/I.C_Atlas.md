#### Stylist Notes  

**🌤 Layering & Practical Styling**  
Choose lightweight layers under formal coats — cotton cardigans or soft knitwear maintain comfort and prevent overheating indoors.  

**🧺 Care & Fabric Guidance**  
Prefer wool-blends or brushed cotton for balance between warmth and easy care. Dry clean only pieces should be reserved for rare events.  

**🎨 Outfit Coordination Tips**

**🧷 Safety & Fit Considerations**  
Avoid long hemlines that limit mobility. Opt for secure buttons or magnetic fasteners for quick dressing.  

**🎠 Activity Versatility**  
Though elegant, ensure coats allow movement for short walks or event play. Ideal for ceremonies, photos, and holiday gatherings.  

**🪡 Play-Friendly Fabrics**  
Seek soft-touch finishes such as brushed wool, cotton velvet, or faux-fur trim for comfort that still feels luxurious.

Pick flexible pieces toddlers can play, sit, and climb in comfortably. Gilets and light puffers are ideal for active days.

#### Stylist Notes

Choose lightweight macs and rain suits that easily layer over cotton jumpers or gilets. Ensure sleeves and cuffs allow for adjustable room to grow.

**🧺 Care & Fabric Guidance**  
Opt for machine-washable waterproofs with sealed seams. Line dry to maintain flexibility and avoid cracking of rubberised coatings.

**🎨 Outfit Coordination Tips**  
Pair bright rainwear with neutral base tones (ivory knits, denim leggings) for visual balance. Add colour-coordinated boots or hats for playful polish.

**🧷 Safety & Fit Considerations**  
Select rainwear with reflective strips and soft closures. Avoid drawstrings or heavy fasteners that could pose entanglement risks.

**🎠 Activity Versatility ** 
Choose pieces that allow full mobility — ideal for park trips or nursery outdoor play. Puddle suits and rain dungarees offer all-in-one practicality.

**🪡 Play-Friendly Fabrics**  
Soft-touch waterproofs ensure comfort while preventing stiffness or noise. Cotton-lined interiors keep rainwear breathable and non-irritating for delicate skin.

### #### Stylist Notes
**🌤 Layering & Practical Styling**  
Layer lightweight cotton or merino pieces under textured jumpers for warmth without bulk. Use tonal layering to balance expressive textures.

**🧺 Care & Fabric Guidance**  
Use wool-safe detergents for longevity. Opt for lined options or soft base layers to protect sensitive toddler skin from heavier wool blends.

**🎨 Character & Colour Detailing**  
Encourage a mix of textures (rib, cable, pointelle) and soft hues (pastel blush, dove grey, oatmeal) to create gentle visual depth.

**🪡 Play-Friendly Fabrics**  
Prioritize soft merino, organic cotton, or cotton-acrylic blends. Avoid unlined heavy alpaca or mohair next to the skin.

**👗 Growth & Longevity Tip**  
Select relaxed or balloon-sleeve shapes to allow longer wear through growth spurts.

**🎠 Activity Versatility**  
Ensure movement comfort — soft stretch and shoulder flexibility for playtime ease.

**🧷 Safety & Fit Consideration**  
Avoid large decorative buttons or embellishments. Check fit around cuffs and neck for comfort.
